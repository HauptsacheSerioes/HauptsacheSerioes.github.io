# Hauptsache Seri√∂s Website

### **NOTE!** We use our Website as a playground to try some new stuff. Do **not** expect to see the best solution for a static page like this.


#### Current status

Build with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). Written in [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#readme). Transforming and bundling with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). To create the static HTML files we are using the [static-site-generator-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/markdalgleish/static-site-generator-webpack-plugin). Deployment with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

Check the [dev branch](https://github.com/HauptsacheSerioes/HauptsacheSerioes.github.io/tree/dev) for the unbundled source.
